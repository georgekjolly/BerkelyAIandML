Jupyter Note Book link : https://github.com/georgekjolly/BerkelyAIandML-5.1/blob/main/prompt.ipynb

I have completed the analysis for Bar and Coffee house coupons. I have used bar charts, histograms, violin plots and pie charts for analsys.
Please find the analysis results below:

**BAR COUPON ANALYSIS FINDINGS**

**>>Based on the observations, the following hypotheses can be formulated about drivers who accepted the bar coupons:**

**Frequency of Bar Visits:**

Drivers who visit bars more frequently (more than 3 times a month) are more likely to accept bar coupons compared to those who visit bars less frequently (3 or fewer times a month).

**Demographics:**

Drivers over the age of 25 who visit bars more than once a month are more likely to accept bar coupons compared to younger or less frequent bar-goers.
Younger drivers (under 30) who frequent bars more than once a month may also show a higher acceptance rate, suggesting a generational or lifestyle factor.

**Passenger Influence:**

Having adult passengers (as opposed to children) increases the likelihood of bar coupon acceptance, possibly due to socializing behaviors or shared interest in bar visits.

**Occupational Impact:**

Drivers with occupations outside of farming, fishing, or forestry are more likely to accept bar coupons. This might relate to lifestyle differences or proximity to urban areas where bars are more common.

**Marital Status:**

Drivers who are not widowed and frequently visit bars are more likely to accept bar coupons, possibly due to differences in social habits or openness to promotions.

**Restaurant Habits and Income:**

Drivers who frequently (more than 4 times a month) visit cheap restaurants and have an income below $50,000 are more likely to accept bar coupons. This suggests that individuals with budget-conscious spending patterns and lower income are more responsive to discounts or promotions.

**>>Drivers with a lower acceptance rate for bar coupons exhibit the following characteristics:**

**Low Frequency of Bar Visits:**

Drivers who go to a bar 3 or fewer times a month are less likely to accept bar coupons. This suggests that their lifestyle or preferences are not aligned with bar-going activities, making them less interested in related promotions.

**Age Factor:**

Drivers who are 25 years old or younger (and do not meet the other criteria for high acceptance) may show less interest in bar coupons. They may prioritize other social activities or lack financial independence to spend on bars.

**Passenger Type:**

Drivers who typically travel with children as passengers are less likely to accept bar coupons. This could indicate family-oriented individuals who are less inclined toward bar visits due to their responsibilities or lifestyle.

**Occupational Profile:**

Drivers involved in farming, fishing, or forestry occupations are less likely to accept bar coupons. These occupations might be associated with rural areas where bars are less accessible, or these individuals may have a cultural preference against frequent bar visits.

**Marital Status:**

Drivers who are widowed tend to have a lower acceptance rate for bar coupons. This could reflect a reduced inclination toward social outings like bar visits.

**Income and Dining Patterns:**

Drivers who go to cheap restaurants fewer than 4 times a month and have an income above $50,000 are less likely to accept bar coupons. This group might have other dining preferences, prioritize more expensive or exclusive venues, or simply not be responsive to promotional offers.

**>Next steps and recommendations :**

*Segmentation and Targeting*

Focus campaigns on high-potential segments such as drivers who visit bars more than 3 times a month, those aged over 25, and drivers with no kid passengers or non-farming occupations.
Create detailed customer profiles to enable personalized offers.

*A/B Testing*

Experiment with coupon variations to identify the best-performing strategies, testing discount levels, validity periods, and delivery methods like SMS or mobile notifications.

*Digital and Location-Based Marketing*

Use geofencing to send real-time coupon offers to drivers near bars, and utilize app-based push notifications for personalized engagement.

**COFFEE HOUSE COUPON ANALYSIS FINDINGS**

**>>Based on the provided observations, the following hypotheses can be formulated about drivers who accepted the Coffee House coupons:**

**Frequency of Coffee House Visits:**

Drivers who visit coffee houses more frequently (more than 3 times a month) are more likely to accept coffee house coupons, indicating a strong preference or habitual behavior for coffee consumption.

**Demographics:**

**1. Young Age and Student Status:**

Drivers aged 20 or younger, particularly students, are more likely to accept coffee house coupons. This suggests that younger individuals, who often associate coffee houses with socializing or studying, are more responsive to such promotions.

**2. Income:**

Drivers in the low-income range (20K–60K) show a higher acceptance rate for coffee house coupons. This may reflect price sensitivity, where discounts make coffee house visits more affordable.

**3. Employment Status:**

Unemployed individuals are more likely to accept coffee house coupons. This could be due to financial constraints, making discounts appealing, or more flexible schedules allowing them to visit coffee houses more frequently.

**4. Situational Factors:**

Drivers are more likely to accept coffee house coupons when:

**Driving to a non-urgent destination:** This suggests that they are more open to spontaneous stops for leisure or refreshment.

**Weather conditions are favorable (rainy or sunny):** These conditions may encourage stops at coffee houses for comfort or relaxation.

**Temperature is 80°F:** This temperature might be perceived as ideal for enjoying a coffee stop.

**Time is 10 AM:** This aligns with morning coffee consumption habits, a common time for coffee breaks.

**Driving direction aligns with the coffee house location:** Convenience plays a role in coupon acceptance, as drivers are more likely to consider stopping when the coffee house is on their route.

**>>Drivers with a lower acceptance rate for Coffee House coupons exhibit the following characteristics:**

**1. Low Frequency of Coffee House Visits:**

Drivers who visit coffee houses 3 or fewer times a month are less likely to accept coupons. This indicates that these drivers are not habitual coffee house visitors and may lack the interest or routine that aligns with such promotions.

**2. Demographics:**

**Older Drivers:**

Drivers over the age of 20 who are not students are less likely to accept coffee house coupons. This group may have different preferences for beverages, dining locations, or social habits.

**Higher-Income Groups:**

Drivers with incomes above 60K are less likely to accept coffee house coupons. They may prefer premium coffee options or establishments where coupons are not a significant factor in decision-making.

**3. Employment Status:**

Employed Individuals:
Drivers with regular employment are less likely to accept coffee house coupons, potentially due to a lack of time for spontaneous coffee stops or different patterns of coffee consumption (e.g., office coffee).

**4. Situational Factors:**

Drivers are less likely to accept coffee house coupons in situations where:

**Driving to an urgent destination:** These drivers are focused on reaching their destination and are less open to stopping for coffee.

**Inconvenient driving direction:** When the coffee house is not aligned with their driving route, the lack of convenience reduces acceptance.

**Less favorable weather conditions:** Extreme weather (e.g., too hot, too cold, or stormy) might discourage stopping for coffee.

**Outside typical coffee consumption hours:** Drivers may be less inclined to accept coupons at times other than morning hours, such as late afternoon or evening.

**>Next Steps and Recommendations:**

*Segmentation and Targeting*

Focus campaigns on frequent coffee house visitors (more than 3 visits/month), students aged ≤ 20, low-income groups (20K–60K), and unemployed individuals.
Build detailed profiles for each segment to enable personalized outreach.

*Personalized Coupon Offers*

Design offers such as loyalty rewards for frequent visitors, student discounts, affordable combos for low-income groups, and weather/time-based promotions (e.g., morning discounts or rainy day offers).

*Behavioral Analysis*

Analyze patterns such as non-urgent travel, travel direction alignment with coffee house locations, and weather conditions (rainy or sunny) to refine targeting strategies.

*A/B Testing*

Experiment with variations like time-sensitive offers (valid at 10 AM), weather-based discounts, and income-specific pricing. Track redemption rates to identify the most effective strategies.

*Digital and Location-Based Marketing*

Use geofencing to send real-time coupons to drivers near coffee houses and app notifications tailored to current weather or travel patterns.

*Partnerships and Cross-Promotions*

Collaborate with educational institutions for student-focused deals and employment agencies to target unemployed individuals.

*Seasonal and Event-Specific Campaigns*

Launch weather-specific campaigns (rainy day comfort deals) and seasonal promotions (iced coffee offers in summer or festive discounts).

*Monitoring and Optimization*

Track coupon performance (redemption rates, weather/time effectiveness) and continuously refine campaigns using data insights.
