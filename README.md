I have completed the analysis for Bar coupons and Coffee house coupons. Please find the findings below:

**BAR COUPON ANALYSIS**

**>>Based on the observations, the following hypotheses can be formulated about drivers who accepted the bar coupons:**

**Frequency of Bar Visits:**

Drivers who visit bars more frequently (more than 3 times a month) are more likely to accept bar coupons compared to those who visit bars less frequently (3 or fewer times a month).

**Demographics:**

Drivers over the age of 25 who visit bars more than once a month are more likely to accept bar coupons compared to younger or less frequent bar-goers.
Younger drivers (under 30) who frequent bars more than once a month may also show a higher acceptance rate, suggesting a generational or lifestyle factor.

**Passenger Influence:**

Having adult passengers (as opposed to children) increases the likelihood of bar coupon acceptance, possibly due to socializing behaviors or shared interest in bar visits.

**Occupational Impact:**

Drivers with occupations outside of farming, fishing, or forestry are more likely to accept bar coupons. This might relate to lifestyle differences or proximity to urban areas where bars are more common.

**Marital Status:**

Drivers who are not widowed and frequently visit bars are more likely to accept bar coupons, possibly due to differences in social habits or openness to promotions.

**Restaurant Habits and Income:**

Drivers who frequently (more than 4 times a month) visit cheap restaurants and have an income below $50,000 are more likely to accept bar coupons. This suggests that individuals with budget-conscious spending patterns and lower income are more responsive to discounts or promotions.
